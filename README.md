Basic NLP Techniques: Tokenization, Stemming, Lemmatization, BoW, TF-IDF, Stopwords

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates basic NLP preprocessing techniques:
1. **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual tokens or words.
2. **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root form.
3. **Lemmatization**: Converting words to their base form (lemma).
4. **Bag of Words (BoW)**: Representing text numerically based on word frequency.
5. **TF-IDF**: Adjusting word importance based on their frequency and distribution.
6. **Stopwords**:Removing these words helps in focusing on meaningful content.


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Libraries:
  - `nltk`
  - `scikit-learn`
